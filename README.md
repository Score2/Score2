### Hi there! 👋
This is Score2.  I am passionate about Minecraft plugin development, as well as networking facilities and smart homes.

Since I'm in school most of the time, maybe I might disappear all day.

Every day in the past, I thought they were both supernatural, because the `1+1 != 2` situation is a regular occurrence.:(

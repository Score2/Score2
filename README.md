### Hi there! 👋
I am a student, and a lot of my work is in Minecraft, but I don’t have enough time, maybe I may miss a lot. Sometimes I'm lazy and even disappear for a day.

Recently, I'm working on web crawler and I've practiced it in real life.

E.g: one of my projects: [ScanGhinfAP](https://github.com/LTHS20/ScanGhinfAP)


It stopped me from worrying about the stuttering of cellular data on campus, and even saved me a lot of data usage charges. I use it to cover almost every corner of the school with my custom WIFI.😅
